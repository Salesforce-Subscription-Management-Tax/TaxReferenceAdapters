This repository contains reference implementations for Avalara Tax Engine Adapter along with one dummy implementation called MockAdapter.This code works with release version 238 and above.

**DISCLAIMER** The code examples in this repository aren't production grade and aren't supposed to be used in production. We don't actively develop and support these examples. Their sole purpose is to serve as examples for partners who can write and publish their own adapters on AppExchange.
